# pixelpalette

Web-based image pixelator with colour palette selection for pixel artists and game developers

![demo](https://github.com/D3REKZHANG/pixelpalette/blob/master/demo.png?raw=true)

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>

Built with React, Next.js, and Material Ui. 

Using this project as an opportunity to learn Next.js and Material UI. So far, they are awesome libraries that make everything so much easier!

I have a processing.js file found at the root path that handles all pixel manipulation logic. I will admit that working with Javascript's canvas and built-in ImageData class is more annoying than I anticipated. It's a great learning opportunity though and I think I have a deeper understanding of Javascript's core features because of it.
